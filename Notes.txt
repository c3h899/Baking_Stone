Testing Methodology
	Batches are Weighed Dry; Then mixed
		CGOLDENWALL Precision Lab Scale (5 kg capacity, 0.01 g accuracy)
		Repeated measurements are withing 0.03 g of eachother.
	Water is added and further mixing is performed
		Excess water is prone to causing density separation of large soapstone grains.
		Soapstone powder is preferable to large grains (> 1 mm)
